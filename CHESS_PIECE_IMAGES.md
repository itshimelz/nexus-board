# Chess Piece Images Integration

## Overview
Updated the GameScreen to use actual chess piece images from the resources/images folder instead of Unicode symbols, providing a more professional and visually appealing chess board.

## Image Files Used
The following chess piece images are loaded from `/src/main/resources/com/himelz/nexusboard/nexusboard/images/`:

### White Pieces
- `white-king-36.png` - White King
- `white-qween-36.png` - White Queen  
- `white-rock-36.png` - White Rook
- `white-bishop-36.png` - White Bishop
- `white-knight-36.png` - White Knight
- `white-pawn-36.png` - White Pawn

### Black Pieces
- `black-king-36.png` - Black King
- `black-qween-36.png` - Black Queen
- `black-rock-36.png` - Black Rook
- `black-bishop-36.png` - Black Bishop
- `black-knight-36.png` - Black Knight
- `black-pawn-36.png` - Black Pawn

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Image Loading System
```java
private Map<String, Image> pieceImages;

private void loadPieceImages() {
    pieceImages = new HashMap<>();
    // Load all 12 chess piece images
    pieceImages.put(\"wk\", new Image(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"/com/himelz/nexusboard/nexusboard/images/white-king-36.png\")));
    // ... (loads all pieces)
}
```

### 2. Piece Code System
Replaced Unicode symbols with standardized piece codes:
- **White pieces**: `wk`, `wq`, `wr`, `wb`, `wn`, `wp`
- **Black pieces**: `bk`, `bq`, `br`, `bb`, `bn`, `bp`

### 3. ImageView Integration
- Chess pieces now display as `ImageView` components
- Images are sized to 50x50 pixels on the board
- Captured pieces display at 24x24 pixels
- Smooth scaling and preserve ratio enabled

### 4. Visual Enhancements
- **Hover Effects**: Pieces scale up (1.1x) on mouse hover
- **Drop Shadows**: Enhanced shadow effects for better depth
- **Smooth Animation**: CSS transitions for scale changes

### 5. Fallback System
Maintains Unicode symbol fallback:
- If images fail to load, automatically falls back to Unicode symbols
- Error handling prevents application crashes
- Console logging for debugging image loading issues

## File Modifications

### GameScreen.java
- Added image loading and caching system
- Updated chess square creation to use ImageView
- Enhanced captured pieces display
- Added hover effects for piece images
- Implemented fallback to Unicode symbols

### game.css

## Testing

To verify the image integration:

1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   mvn javafx:run
   ```

2. **Check console output**:
   - Should see \"Successfully loaded 12 chess piece images\"
   - No error messages about missing images

3. **Visual verification**:
   - Chess board displays piece images instead of Unicode
   - Captured pieces show as small images
   - Hover effects work on pieces
   - Professional chess set appearance

4. **Fallback testing**:
   - Rename image files to test fallback
   - Should display Unicode symbols if images unavailable

## Summary
